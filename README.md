# Overview

This is a collection of helm charts to run an Ethereum full node, focused on staking.

The use of Web3signer is mandatory.

This was forked from the Stakewise helm charts and uses some of the same tools to sync keys to the PostgreSQL DB,
but without the use of Stakewise vaults.

# License

These charts are AGPL licensed.
